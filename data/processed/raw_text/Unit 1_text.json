It is a\n\nvaluable technique for gathering data that is publicly available on the internet but not readily\n\n\n\n\nDr .M. Mohammed Mustafa     Associate Professor             Department of AI & DS",
    "accessible in a structured format. Here’s a detailed overview of web scraping, including\n\naccessing different sources of data.\n\nSteps in Web Scraping\n\n    1.  Identifying the Target Website:\n\n         o  Determine the website(s) from which you want to extract data.\n\n         o   Identify the specific pages and the data elements (e.g., text, images, links) you\n\n              need.\n\n    2.  Understanding the Website Structure:\n\n         o  Analyze the HTML structure of the web pages using browser developer tools\n\n                  (e.g., Chrome DevTools).\n\n         o   Identify the tags, classes, and IDs that contain the data of interest.\n\n    3.  Setting Up the Scraping Environment:\n\n         o  Choose a programming language (commonly Python) and install necessary\n\n                 libraries (e.g., BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Selenium).\n\n         o  Set up a virtual environment to manage dependencies.\n\n    4. Making HTTP Requests:\n\n         o  Use libraries like requests to send HTTP requests to the target web pages.\n\n         o  Handle different HTTP methods (GET, POST) and manage request headers for\n\n              access control and session management.\n\n    5.  Parsing the HTML Content:\n\n         o  Use HTML parsing libraries like BeautifulSoup to navigate and extract the\n\n               desired data from the HTML response.\n\n         o  Techniques include finding elements by tag, class, ID, and using CSS selectors\n\n              or XPath.\n\n      Example in Python using BeautifulSoup:\n\n      import requests\n\n      from bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\n       url = \"https://example.com\"\n\n      response = requests.get(url)\n\n          if response.status_code == 200:\n\n        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, \"html.parser\")\n\n        # Extract data by tag\n\n            titles = soup.find_all(\"h2\")\n\n         for title in titles:\n\n\nDr .M. Mohammed Mustafa     Associate Professor             Department of AI & DS",
    "print(title.get_text())\n\n        else:\n\n         print(f\"Failed to retrieve data: {response.status_code}\")\n\n    6. Handling Pagination:\n\n         o  Many websites display data across multiple pages. Implement logic to handle\n\n              pagination by identifying the structure of next page links.\n\n         o  Loop through pages to collect data iteratively.\n\n    7.  Storing the Extracted Data:\n\n         o  Save the scraped data in a structured format (e.g., CSV, JSON, database).\n\n         o  Ensure data integrity and handle duplicates if necessary.\n\n      Example of saving data to a CSV file:\n\n      import csv\n\n      with open(\"data.csv\", mode=\"w\", newline=\"\", encoding=\"utf-8\") as file:\n\n         writer = csv.writer(file)\n\n         writer.writerow([\"Title\", \"Link\"])\n\n         for title, link in data:\n\n            writer.writerow([title, link])\n\n    8.  Respecting Ethical Considerations and Legal Issues:\n\n         o  Always review and comply with the website’s robots.txt file and terms of\n\n                service.\n\n         o  Avoid excessive scraping to prevent overloading the website’s servers.\n\n         o  Use respectful time delays between requests (e.g., time.sleep() in Python).\n\n\nAccessing Different Sources of Data via Web Scraping\n\n    1.  Static Web Pages:\n\n         o  Pages with fixed content that doesn’t change dynamically.\n\n         o  Use direct HTML parsing techniques to extract data.\n\n    2. Dynamic Web Pages:\n\n         o  Pages that load content dynamically using JavaScript (e.g., infinite scrolling,\n\n         AJAX calls).\n\n         o  Use tools like Selenium or Puppeteer to simulate browser interactions and\n\n              capture rendered HTML.\n\n      Example in Python using Selenium:\n\n      from selenium import webdriver\n\n\nDr .M.

    "driver = webdriver.Chrome()\n\n       driver.get(\"https://example.com\")\n\n      # Interact with the page if necessary\n\n       content = driver.page_source\n\n\n      # Parse the content with BeautifulSoup\n\n      soup = BeautifulSoup(content, \"html.parser\")\n\n         titles = soup.find_all(\"h2\")\n\n       for title in titles:\n\n          print(title.get_text())\n\n       driver.quit()\n\n    3. APIs as a Source of Data:\n\n         o  Some websites provide APIs for accessing their data in a structured format.\n\n         o  Use API endpoints to fetch data directly, which is often more efficient and\n\n                reliable than scraping HTML.\n\n      Example of making an API call:\n\n      import requests\n\n       api_url = \"https://api.example.com/data\"\n\n      headers = {\"Authorization\": \"Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\"}\n\n      response = requests.get(api_url, headers=headers)\n\n          if response.status_code == 200:\n\n        data = response.json()\n\n         print(data)\n\n        else:\n\n         print(f\"Failed to retrieve data: {response.status_code}\")\n\n    4. Data Aggregators and Public Data Repositories:\n\n         o  Websites that aggregate data from multiple sources or provide public datasets\n\n                  (e.g., Kaggle, Data.gov).\n\n         o  Often provide bulk downloads or API access for easier data acquisition.\n\n    5.  Social Media Platforms:\n\n         o  Extract data from social media sites using their APIs  (e.g., Twitter API,\n\n            Facebook Graph API).\n\n         o  Requires understanding of API usage policies and handling authentication\n\n               tokens.\n\n\nDr .M.
