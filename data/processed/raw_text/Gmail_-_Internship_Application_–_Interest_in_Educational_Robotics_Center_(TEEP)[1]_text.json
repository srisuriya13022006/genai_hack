I am writing to express my interest in the TEEP internship at the Educational Robotics Center (ERC). I\n  recently learned about the program and am very excited about the opportunity to work on robotics and reinforcement learning\n  (RL), especially the Sim-to-Real challenge.\n\n   I am a third year Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AIML) student and eager to gain hands on experience. I am ready to\n  work for up to six months and willing to learn and contribute as needed.\n\n   I have attached my CV for your review. Please let me know if you need any more details. I look forward to your response.\n\n  Best regards,\n\n MOHANASUNDARAM G\n\n\n\n     MOHAN_RESUME.pdf\n     230 KB\n\n\nsaeedvand <saeedvand@ntnu.edu.tw>                                                                Tue, Mar 18, 2025 at 12:08 PM\nTo: MOHANASUNDARAM G AI-ML <mohanasundaram.g2022ai-ml@sece.ac.in>\nCc: UGO ROUX <ugo.roux31@gmail.com>\n\n\n Dear MOHANASUNDARAM,\n\n  It is nice to hear your interest.
