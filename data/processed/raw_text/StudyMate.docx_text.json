    "​\n\n\n    StudyMate: An AI-Powered PDF-Based Q&A System for\n                         Students\n\n1.​Project Description\n\nStudyMate is an AI-powered academic assistant that enables students to interact with their\nstudy materials—such as textbooks, lecture notes, and research papers—in a\nconversational, question-answering format. Instead of passively reading large PDF\ndocuments or relying on manual searches for specific information, users can simply upload\none or more PDFs and ask natural-language questions. StudyMate responds with direct,\nwell-contextualized answers, referenced from the source content.\n\nThe system is built using Python and integrates several core technologies:\n\n    ●​ PyMuPDF for accurate and efficient text extraction from PDF files.\n    ●​  SentenceTransformers + FAISS for embedding and retrieving semantically similar\n        text chunks based on user queries.\n    ●​ IBM Watsonx LLM—specifically the Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct model—for generating\n       contextual and factual answers grounded in the uploaded content.\n    ●​  Streamlit for developing a visually polished, interactive interface that runs locally.\n\nUsers can drag and drop multiple academic PDFs into the interface. Once uploaded, the\nsystem preprocesses the content by splitting it into overlapping text chunks and building a\nsemantic index. When a question is submitted, StudyMate retrieves the most relevant\nchunks using FAISS and feeds them, along with the query, into the LLM. The answer is\nreturned in real-time and displayed alongside source references and a downloadable Q&A\nlog.\n\nThis project demonstrates the power of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in an\neducational context and provides a practical, student-centric use case for large language\nmodels. By combining real-time document parsing, semantic search, and generative AI,\nStudyMate creates an intelligent and efficient study companion that turns static academic\ncontent into an interactive learning experience.",
    "​\n\n\n2.​User Scenarios\n\nStudyMate is designed to support a variety of realistic academic use cases where students\ninteract with digital study materials. The system offers a seamless pipeline, from PDF\nupload to contextual answer generation, making it highly suitable for self-paced learning,\nexam revision, and quick concept clarification. Below are key usage scenarios that\ndemonstrate the flexibility and relevance of StudyMate in a student’s workflow:\n\n\n\nScenario 1: Concept Clarification During Study\n\nA student revising for an upcoming exam uploads their lecture notes in PDF format. They\nwant to revisit a difficult concept—such as “What is overfitting in machine learning?”\n\n    ●​ The student types this question into the query input box.\n    ●​ StudyMate retrieves the most relevant explanations from the PDF.\n    ●​ The LLM generates a clear, concise definition grounded in the extracted content.\n    ●​ The source paragraph is shown below the answer for verification.\n\nThis enables the student to get accurate help instantly without breaking their concentration\nto skim through pages.\n\n\n\nScenario 2: Studying from Digital Textbooks\n\nWhile reading a digital textbook like “Introduction to Machine Learning with Python”, the\nstudent encounters a term they don’t fully understand.\n\n    ●​ They upload the full textbook PDF into StudyMate.\n    ●​  Instead of switching to Google or ChatGPT separately, they ask:\n       “Explain the difference between classification and regression.”\n    ●​ The system delivers an answer directly from the book, with references.\n\nThis scenario enhances learning by providing answers strictly grounded in the student’s\nown material.\n\n\n\nScenario 3: Preparing for Viva or Open-Book Tests\n\nA user preparing for a viva exam wants to quiz themselves on key concepts.\n\n    ●​ They upload a PDF of summarized notes.",
    "​\n\n\n    ●​ Then ask multiple questions like:\n             o​  “What is principal component analysis?”\n             o​  “What is the use of sklearn in Python?”\n    ●​ StudyMate logs all questions and answers in a session history.\n\nBefore the test, the user downloads the Q&A history as a text file for quick revision.\n\n\n\nScenario 4: Multi-PDF Research Compilation\n\nA research student has three papers on a specific topic.\n\n    ●​ They upload all three PDFs into StudyMate at once.\n    ●​ Then ask:\n      “What do these papers say about ensemble methods?”\n    ●​ StudyMate finds the most relevant excerpts across documents and synthesizes the\n       response.\n\nThis cross-PDF reasoning allows for research-wide concept extraction and thematic\nlearning.",
    "​\n\n\n3.​Technical Architecture\n\nStudyMate is built on a modular, pipeline-based architecture designed to enable fast,\nscalable, and traceable question answering over academic PDFs. The architecture consists\nof six primary layers, each fulfilling a distinct role—from document ingestion to AI response\ngeneration and UI presentation.\n\nInput Layer:\n\n    ●​ PDF Upload:\n       Users can upload one or more PDF files through a drag-and-drop uploader in the\n        Streamlit interface. Uploaded files are read and parsed using PyMuPDF.\n    ●​  Text Extraction & Chunking:\n\n      Each PDF is converted into clean, readable text. This text is then split into\n       overlapping chunks (typically 500 words with 100-word overlap) to ensure context\n       continuity during retrieval.\n\n\n\nSemantic Retrieval Layer:\n\n    ●​ Embedding Model:\n      StudyMate uses the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model from SentenceTransformers to convert\n       each chunk and the user’s query into semantic vectors.\n    ●​  Vector Indexing with FAISS:\n      The vectors are stored in a FAISS index for fast similarity search. When a user asks a\n        question, FAISS retrieves the top-k most semantically similar chunks (typically k =\n         3).\n\n\n\nLLM Inference Layer:\n\n    ●​ Prompt Construction:\n     A dynamic prompt is assembled by combining the user’s question with the retrieved\n       context chunks.\n    ●​ Watsonx Integration:\n      The prompt is sent to the IBM Watsonx LLM API using the ibm-watsonx-ai SDK.\n             o​  Model Used: mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v01\n             o​  Settings: Greedy decoding, moderate temperature, and a token limit of 300\n    ●​ Response Handling:\n      The model returns a concise, contextual answer. The response is linked with the\n        original chunks for source traceability.",
    "​\n\n\nData Persistence Layer:\n\n    ●​  Session History Tracking:\n        All questions and corresponding answers are logged in memory per session.\n    ●​ Export Functionality:\n      The Q&A log can be downloaded as a .txt file. Future versions may support CSV or\n      Markdown exports.\n\n\n\nFrontend & UI Layer (Streamlit)\n\n    ●​ Modern Interface:\n      The interface is styled with a custom background and soft-themed containers.\n    ●​ Components Include:\n             o​ PDF Uploader (multi-file support)\n             o​  Text input for asking questions\n             o​  Answer card with clear formatting\n             o​  Expandable “Referenced Paragraphs” section\n             o​  Session-wide Q&A history\n             o​  One-click download for answer logs\n    ●​  Live Feedback:\n       Status banners show upload success, readiness, or failure in real time.\n\n\n\nConfiguration & Security Layer\n\n    ●​ Environment Variables (.env):\n             o​  IBM_API_KEY\n             o​  IBM_PROJECT_ID\n             o​  IBM_URL\n             These are securely loaded using python-dotenv and passed to the Watsonx\n                  client.\n    ●​ Model Switching:\n      The system can easily be adapted to work with other IBM models like Granite,\n       FLAN-T5, or LLaMA by updating a single model ID in the backend.",

    "​\n\n\n5.​Project Workflow\n\nThe development of the StudyMate system was organized into three key milestones, each\nfocused on implementing and validating a specific subsystem. The methodology emphasized\nmodular code design, iterative testing, and end-to-end integration of all major components\nincluding the user interface, retrieval engine, and IBM Watsonx LLM backend.\n\nMilestone 1: PDF Parsing and Chunk Preparation\n\nThis milestone focused on building a robust text extraction and chunking pipeline to convert\nunstructured academic PDFs into semantically meaningful units ready for embedding and\nretrieval. The process accounted for document diversity—ranging from textbooks and\nlecture notes to research articles—and prioritized the retention of contextual coherence\nduring segmentation.\n\nActivity 1.1 – Text Extraction from PDFs\nThe system leveraged the PyMuPDF library (imported as fitz) for extracting text from PDF\nfiles. This library provided page-level access to all visible text elements while preserving\nparagraph breaks and reading order. During development, multiple formatting\ninconsistencies were encountered across PDF types—such as split headers, repeated\nfooters, and column layouts. These were manually analyzed and heuristically handled by\nnormalizing the extracted string. Each file was opened as a stream, processed page-by-page,\nand concatenated into a master document buffer. This stage ensured that the text used for\ndownstream semantic search was clean and minimally noisy.\n\nActivity 1.2 – Chunk Segmentation for Retrieval-Augmented Generation\nOnce extracted, the document content was segmented into overlapping text chunks to be\nused as retrievable units. The chosen configuration was 500 words per chunk with a 100-\nword overlap. This overlap was critical to maintaining context continuity across\nboundaries—especially in academic material where explanations or equations span\nmultiple paragraphs. The segmentation algorithm iterated through the tokenized word list\nwith a sliding window approach and appended all generated segments to a list for\nembedding. Each chunk was stored alongside metadata (source filename, chunk number)\nfor future traceability.\n\nActivity 1.3 – Multi-PDF Aggregation and Dynamic Index Handling\nIn addition to single-document support, the system was extended to handle multiple PDFs\nuploaded together. Each file was independently processed through the extraction and\nchunking pipeline, and all resultant chunks were merged into a single corpus. This design\nallowed the user to ask a question across all uploaded documents simultaneously—\nenabling multi-source semantic retrieval. The FAISS index was then constructed over the\naggregated embeddings, with internal references maintained to map retrieved chunks back\nto their original document context.",
    "​\n\n\nActivity 1.4 – Intermediate Testing and Debugging\nTo verify the integrity of the chunking process, intermediate outputs were printed and\nmanually checked for logical completeness. Key focus areas included sentence cutoffs at\nboundaries, duplicate content due to overlapping windows, and retention of mathematical\nor symbolic notations. Representative examples from both technical and non-technical\ndocuments were tested to ensure generalizability.",
    "​\n\n\nMilestone 2: Embedding, Indexing, and Retrieval\n\nThis milestone was dedicated to building the core retrieval engine responsible for\nconnecting a user’s question to the most semantically relevant sections of the uploaded\nPDFs. It involved transforming text into vector representations, indexing them efficiently,\nand retrieving relevant chunks using vector similarity methods.\n\nActivity 2.1 – Embedding Generation using Sentence Transformers\nThe sentence-transformers library was used to embed each chunk into a fixed-size vector.\nThe selected model, all-MiniLM-L6-v2, provided a good tradeoff between performance and\nembedding quality. It generates 384-dimensional embeddings optimized for semantic\nsimilarity tasks. The model was preloaded and cached to accelerate repeated inference.\nEach text chunk was passed through this encoder, and the output vectors were appended to\na NumPy array representing the full document embedding matrix. Testing revealed that\neven short academic paragraphs were effectively captured by the model, with conceptually\nsimilar chunks having noticeably closer vector distances.\n\nActivity 2.2 – FAISS Index Construction and Optimization\nOnce embeddings were generated, they were indexed using Facebook AI Similarity Search\n(FAISS). A flat L2 index (IndexFlatL2) was used for its simplicity and effectiveness in CPU-\nonly environments. Each embedding vector was inserted into the index alongside a\nreference to its original chunk. The index was serialized and loaded into memory at runtime\nfor fast access. The cosine similarity scores were computed internally during queries,\nenabling top-k retrieval of contextually similar segments. Retrieval performance was tested\nwith varying k-values (k=3, 5, 10), and k=3 was selected as optimal for balancing relevance\nand token length in the prompt.\n\nActivity 2.3 – Query Embedding and Chunk Retrieval\nWhen a user submitted a question, the same embedding model was used to convert the\nquestion into a vector. This query vector was compared against the FAISS index, and the\nclosest chunks were returned. The retrieval logic included score normalization and chunk\nde-duplication across files. Each result was returned in ranked order and included metadata\nfor display and prompt formatting. This approach ensured that only the most relevant, high-\nconfidence segments were passed to the language model.\n\nActivity 2.4 – Relevance Validation and Performance Tuning\nRetrieved chunks were manually examined against various academic queries to validate\ntheir appropriateness. Questions like “What is overfitting?”, “Explain classification vs\nregression”, and “List evaluation metrics in ML” were tested. The returned context was\nconsistently aligned with the intent of the query, demonstrating strong semantic matching.\nTo reduce latency in multi-document indexing, redundant chunk filtering and embedding\nreuse were implemented in later iterations.",
    "​\n\n\nMilestone 3: Watsonx LLM Integration and Prompt Construction\n\nThis milestone focused on the generation of final answers using IBM Watsonx foundation\nmodels. It covered model selection, credential setup, prompt formatting, and response\nhandling. The objective was to ensure that the answers generated were coherent, relevant,\nand contextually grounded in the content retrieved from the uploaded PDFs.\n\nActivity 3.1 – IBM Credential Setup and Environment Configuration\nTo securely interact with IBM Watsonx APIs, environment variables were stored in a .env\nfile. These included IBM_API_KEY, IBM_PROJECT_ID, and IBM_URL. The python-dotenv\npackage was used to load these values during runtime. The credentials were passed into the\nModel object from the ibm-watsonx-ai SDK, which initialized the LLM client. The endpoint\nURL was configured to match the regional deployment of the Watsonx instance (e.g., us-\nsouth.ml.cloud.ibm.com). This setup enabled authenticated and persistent access to the\nfoundation model.\n\nActivity 3.2 – Prompt Construction using Retrieved Chunks\nThe prompt fed to the LLM was dynamically assembled using the retrieved top-k text\nchunks and the user’s question. The prompt followed a consistent format:\n\n    ●​ A system message that framed the task (“Answer based strictly on the following\n        context”).\n\n    ●​ Each chunk presented as a bullet point or paragraph block.\n\n    ●​ The user question appended at the end.\n\n    ●​ A final instruction to avoid hallucination or unsupported claims.\n\nThe formatting emphasized clarity and token efficiency. Each prompt was encoded and\nvalidated to ensure it remained under the model’s token limit (typically 2048 tokens), with\nthe most relevant chunks prioritized if truncation was needed.\n\nActivity 3.3 – Model Invocation and Parameter Tuning\nThe chosen model was mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v01, hosted via IBM Watsonx.ai.\nThis model was selected for its strong performance on open-ended question answering, low\nlatency, and support for factual reasoning. The generation parameters were:\n\n    ●​ Max new tokens: 300\n\n    ●​  Decoding method: Greedy (no sampling)\n\n    ●​  Temperature: 0.5 (for mild variation while retaining factual tone)",
    "​\n\n\n\nThe model call was wrapped in exception-handling logic to manage failures, timeouts, or\nmisformatted responses. Returned answers were decoded, stripped of extraneous\nwhitespace, and stored alongside their corresponding queries.\n\nActivity 3.4 – Output Structuring and Traceability\nThe final LLM answer was displayed in the user interface, accompanied by the retrieved\nchunks used for context. This design allowed users to verify the grounding of the response.\nAdditionally, the answer was appended to a session dictionary for persistent storage and\nlater export.\n\nTesting was performed using sample questions from the “Introduction to Machine Learning\nwith Python” textbook, confirming that the system produced clear, accurate, and referenced\nanswers across various topics.",
    "​\n\n\nMilestone 4: Streamlit Interface Development and Session Handling\n\nThis milestone involved the implementation of the front-end interface for the StudyMate\nsystem using Streamlit. The goal was to create a clean, intuitive, and responsive UI that\nwould allow users to upload documents, ask questions, view AI-generated answers, and\ndownload their full interaction history. Emphasis was placed on minimalism, accessibility,\nand real-time responsiveness.\n\nActivity 4.1 – UI Layout Design and Component Structuring\nThe application was developed using Streamlit’s layout primitives such as containers,\ncolumns, and expanders. The set_page_config() function was used at the start to define the\npage title, layout width, and favicon. The top section of the app featured a background\nimage embedded using base64 encoding, which was styled via inline HTML and CSS to\ncreate a fixed, scrollable effect. The central interaction area included the following\ncomponents:\n\n    ●​ PDF uploader (st.file_uploader) with multi-file support\n\n    ●​  Question input text box\n\n    ●​ Submit button for triggering query execution\n\n    ●​ Answer display area\n\n    ●​  Reference chunk viewer in expandable form\n\nEach component was arranged vertically, with logical groupings for input, output, and\ninteraction history.\n\nActivity 4.2 – Answer Display and Context Tracing\nAfter the user submitted a question, the interface displayed the AI-generated answer in a\nclearly styled response block. The answer was rendered using Markdown for readability,\nwith font adjustments for visual emphasis. Below the answer, an expandable section\nrevealed the original text chunks used in generating the response. This traceability was\ncritical in academic settings, ensuring users could verify the origin and relevance of every\nclaim made by the model. Additionally, fallback messages were displayed if retrieval or\ngeneration failed, improving user feedback and error transparency.\n\nActivity 4.3 – Session-Based Q&A History Tracking\nTo maintain continuity during a session, every question and corresponding answer was\nstored in a session_state variable. These entries were displayed sequentially at the bottom\nof the interface under a \"Q&A History\" header. Each history block was rendered with\ndistinct styling to separate the question from its answer, preserving readability. This\nenabled users to scroll back through their previous queries without re-entering them.",
    "​\n\n\nActivity 4.4 – Downloadable Transcript Functionality\nA dedicated button was provided to download the session's Q&A history as a plain text file.\nWhen clicked, the session dictionary was serialized into a structured .txt format with\ntimestamps and delimiters between question-answer pairs. This feature was especially\nuseful for students who wished to save the session for offline revision or share it with peers.\nThe implementation used Streamlit’s st.download_button, with data formatting handled in-\nmemory to eliminate the need for filesystem access.\n\nActivity 4.5 – Final Integration and Live Testing\nAll components—backend pipeline, LLM engine, retrieval index, and frontend—were\nintegrated and tested as a cohesive system. Edge cases such as blank input, multiple\nsimultaneous uploads, and long answers were tested to ensure resilience. The application\nwas run on Windows 11 using the terminal command streamlit run streamlit_app.py and\nconsistently produced accurate, grounded answers from academic PDFs across domains.",
    "​\n\n\n6.​Project Output\n\nThe final implementation of the StudyMate system results in a fully operational, user-\nfriendly interface that enables real-time interaction with academic PDFs using natural\nlanguage queries. The project output spans multiple dimensions—interface usability,\nbackend responsiveness, semantic accuracy, and session-level continuity. This section\ndocuments the output interface and features with reference to actual use cases and\ninterface screenshots provided during testing.\n\nComponent 1: User Interface Layout and Aesthetic\n\nThe application interface is rendered using the Streamlit framework with a custom\nlayout and background image. The homepage is titled “H ]_ StudyMate”, and includes\na fixed, wide layout with a clean arrangement of inputs and outputs. Visual elements\nsuch as buttons, headers, input boxes, and scrollable sections are styled using\nembedded CSS to provide a modern look while maintaining readability.\n\nThe interface is divided into four major sections:\n\n    ●​ Header area: Project title and branding\n\n    ●​ PDF uploader section: File input area supporting drag-and-drop\n\n    ●​ Query interaction section: Text input, submit button, and generated response\n\n    ●​  Session history section: Scrollable log of all Q&A interactions\n\nThe layout responds well to various screen sizes and operating systems, and all user\ninteractions are processed locally without redirection or page reloads.",
    "​\n\n\nComponent 2: Multi-PDF Upload and Preprocessing Pipeline\n\nUsers are provided with a file uploader widget that supports uploading multiple academic\nPDFs in a single session. Upon upload:\n\n    ●​  The content from each file is extracted using PyMuPDF and processed sequentially.\n\n    ●​  Each document is split into overlapping chunks of approximately 500 words with\n      100-word overlap to preserve context flow.\n\n    ●​  All chunks across all PDFs are stored in a unified list, embedded into dense vectors,\n      and indexed using FAISS.\n\nA status message confirms successful upload and processing, and the backend logic ensures\nthat duplicate files or invalid formats are rejected gracefully. This feature supports seamless\nintegration of study notes, textbooks, and research papers into a single searchable\nknowledge base.",
    "​\n\n\nComponent 3: Question Submission and AI-Generated Answers\n\nThe central functionality of StudyMate revolves around its intelligent question-answering\ninterface. A text input box allows the user to ask any question related to the uploaded\ncontent. Once submitted:\n\n    ●​  The question is embedded into a vector using the same model as the chunks (all-\n       MiniLM-L6-v2).\n\n    ●​  FAISS returns the top three most semantically relevant chunks.\n\n    ●​  These are inserted into a pre-defined prompt template, followed by the user’s\n        question.\n\n    ●​  The prompt is submitted to the Watsonx Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct model via the IBM\n        API.\n\n    ●​  The model responds with a structured, context-aware answer.\n\nThe generated answer is rendered within a styled response card. Below the answer, the user\ncan expand a section labeled “Referenced Paragraphs” to view the exact source chunks used\nfor that specific question. This feature ensures that all AI-generated output is verifiable and\naligned with the uploaded content.",
    "​\n\n\nComponent 4: Live Session History Tracking and Downloadable Transcript\n\nIn addition to displaying real-time answers, the system maintains a complete record of all\ninteractions within a session. Every user question and its corresponding AI response is\nstored in memory and rendered at the bottom of the interface in reverse chronological\norder. Each entry is displayed in a collapsible format with distinct styling for questions and\nanswers.\n\nThis session history is particularly useful for revision and review. At any point, the user can\nclick the “Download Q&A History” button to export the full conversation as a plain text file.\nThe exported file includes clear delimiters between each Q&A pair and is compatible with\nany text editor. This functionality simulates a personalized AI tutor log, making the system\nvaluable not just for real-time assistance but also for long-term study support.\n\n\n\nComponent 5: System Responsiveness and Stability\n\nThe full pipeline—from PDF upload to answer generation—was tested on a local\ndevelopment environment (Windows 11, Python 3.10) and demonstrated consistent\nresponsiveness. Latency from question submission to answer display averaged under five\nseconds, depending on input length and model load. Error handling routines were\nimplemented for cases such as:\n\n    ●​  Missing PDFs\n\n    ●​ Empty questions\n\n    ●​  Model timeout or invalid responses\n\n    ●​  Retrieval failure due to inadequate content\n\nEach of these cases triggered appropriate fallback messages or warnings, thereby\nimproving system robustness and user trust.",
    "​\n\n\n7.​Conclusion\n\nThe StudyMate project successfully demonstrates the practical application of Retrieval-\nAugmented Generation (RAG) in the educational domain. It provides a seamless way for\nstudents to interact with static academic PDFs by converting them into dynamic, queryable\nknowledge sources. Through the integration of semantic search, prompt engineering, and\nlarge language models, the system transforms traditional reading into an engaging and\nefficient learning experience.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, the project integrates multiple AI components—including\nPyMuPDF for parsing, SentenceTransformers and FAISS for retrieval, and IBM Watsonx\nfoundation models for answer generation—within a clean and modular pipeline. Each\nsubsystem was individually validated and collectively integrated into a user-friendly\nStreamlit application. The inclusion of session history, downloadable transcripts, and\nreference tracking makes the tool highly usable for real-world academic study and exam\npreparation.\n\nDuring development, particular attention was given to the accuracy, traceability, and\ntransparency of the responses generated. The system ensures that every answer is\ngrounded in the content of the uploaded documents and verifiable through reference\nparagraphs. This design choice positions StudyMate as a responsible and academically\nappropriate use of generative AI.\n\nStudyMate represents a strong foundation for further development. Potential future\nenhancements include support for table and diagram parsing, integration of OCR for image-\nbased PDFs, confidence scoring for retrieved answers, and deployment as a web-based\nservice for broader access.\n\nIn summary, StudyMate meets its core objective—to serve as an intelligent, AI-powered\nstudy assistant that allows students to engage with their learning material more effectively\nand efficiently. It stands as a practical, innovative, and extensible solution that leverages the\nstrengths of generative AI to enhance education."
